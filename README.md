# MealMapper
MealMapper is an all-inclusive weekly meal planning application. Users are guided through determining their caloric needs, macronutrient ratios, and activity level. With this information, a user is empowered to build weekly meal plans to help achieve their fitness goals.

## How It Works
Users create an account and complete their fitness profile. Information is stored into the MongoDB database and updated as the user tracks their progress.

The MealGrid view offers users the power to create customized weekly meal plans with consideration for Macronutrient ratios and total caloric consumption.

Convenient shopping lists allow users to convert weekly meal plans into efficient grocery store trips.

Finally, the user is able to make adjustments to their activity levels, macronutrient ratios, and fitness goals as they make progress through their Fitness Journey.
